        <h1>ROT13 Cipher</h1>
        <p>ROT13 (or ROT-13) is a very simple form of encryption cipher. It is a variant of a Caesar cipher. In it, the
            alphabet is written in two lines, of 13 characters each. Encryption, and decryption is done by simply
            switching the letters that are below each other. That way, A becomes N, B becomes O, and so on.</p>
